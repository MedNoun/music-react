## Steps for setting up the project :
This is a react native project which runs on expo 
1. download the expo go app from app store or play store
2. clone the repository
3. `nvm use 16.15.1` - expo doesn't work on newer versions of node
4. run `npm install` to install dependencies 
5. run `npm start` or `expo start` on the terminal
6. set your local ip address in `src/components/Recorder.js` (variable `baseURL`)
7. a qr code will show up scan it with your camera if you are on Iphone or open the expo app and scan it on android
8. the app should bundle and open up on your phone !
